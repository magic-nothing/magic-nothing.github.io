                <p>The Great Beyond is Spencer O’Karma. O’Karma was born in Brooklyn and raised in the theatre by an eccentric director grandmother and an artist mother who introduced him to Harry Nilsson and Guided By Voices at a young age. O’Karma was classically trained on the violin, and at age 12 he began writing and recording surrealist songs using cardboard boxes, hammers and phasers.</p>

                <p>After moving to California, O’Karma immersed himself in the Bay Area punk scene as the songwriter/guitarist in ParasitesGo!. For the next five years he toured with underground acts like Abi Yoyos and Shakey Bones while continuing his experimental 4-track recordings in private. He later sang and wrote for garage-noise band Sopors and art-punk group A. Elk, until he took a performance hiatus to focus on painting and writing.</p>

                <p>O’Karma continued to demo obsessively for the next decade, releasing The Blue Garage in 2014, Metafreak in 2015, and various EPs to friends. The Great Beyond’s first official release, Heaven Is A Room, is the culmination of O’Karma’s lo-fi period. Compiled and mixed in Los Angeles with old friend Marmalade Mountain, HIAR is a rock and roll record recorded in the vein of Raw Power, evoking shades of early Brian Eno, Kate Bush, and Big Star.</p>

                <p>The Great Beyond is a self-proclaimed “word junkie,” and the imagery on Heaven Is A Room references Albert Einstein, the ghost of Christ haunting a futuristic Mary Magdalene, starry-eyed allusions to Shakespeare, and a new Eden rising from the ashes.</p>
